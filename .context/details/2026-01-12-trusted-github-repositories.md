## Why GitHub is Safer Than the Toolbox

| GitHub | Toolbox |
|--------|---------|
| All code is visible before you use it | Code is hidden until it's in your game |
| Many developers review popular projects | Only you see what's inside after adding |
| You can see the project's history | No history - just a snapshot |
| Problems are reported publicly in Issues | No public problem reports |
| Shows how many people trust it (stars) | Harder to know if it's safe |

**The big difference:** On GitHub, there are no secrets. Everyone can see every line of code. If someone tried to hide something bad, other developers would spot it and warn people.

## How to Check if a GitHub Repo is Trustworthy

Before using anything from GitHub, do this quick safety check:

### The Trust Checklist

| Look For | Why It Matters | Good Sign |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Stars** | Shows how many people like it | 100+ stars is good, 1000+ is great |
| **Recent updates** | Shows it's being maintained | Updated in last few months |
| **Contributors** | More eyes = safer code | Multiple people working on it |
| **README file** | Explains what it does | Clear, helpful documentation |
| **Issues tab** | Shows if problems get fixed | Issues get responses and closed |
| **License** | Legal permission to use | Has a license file (MIT is common) |

### Red Flags (Be Careful!)

| Warning Sign | What It Might Mean |
|--------------|-------------------|
| No stars or very few | Nobody has reviewed it |
| No updates in years | Might be abandoned or broken |
| Only one contributor | Less review of the code |
| No README | Creator didn't explain what it does |
| Lots of open issues with no responses | Problems aren't being fixed |

## Quick Reference Card

```
SAFE SOURCES:
  Roblox Toolbox + "Endorsed" filter
  github.com/Roblox (official)
  github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo
  github.com/Quenty
  github.com/Sleitnick
  github.com/evaera

CHECK BEFORE USING:
  Stars?        (more = more trust)
  Updates?      (recent = maintained)
  README?       (explains what it does)
  Contributors? (more eyes = safer)

RED FLAGS:
  No stars
  No updates in years
  No documentation
  Only 1 contributor
  Lots of ignored issues
```

---

## Summary

You asked a really smart question about staying safe! Here's the simple version:

1. **Toolbox with "Endorsed" filter** = Safe and easy
2. **GitHub from trusted developers** = Safe because you can see everything
3. **Random Toolbox models without checking** = Risky!

When in doubt, ask your dad to help you check the code. Learning to spot safe vs. sketchy code is a real developer skill!
