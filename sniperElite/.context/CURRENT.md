# Current Session

## Status
**Session Started:** 2025-01-12
**Focus:** Environment Setup for Game Development

## Next Action
- [ ] Open a new terminal and type `commands` to see all aliases
- [ ] Run `serve` to start Rojo
- [ ] Open Roblox Studio and connect via Plugins > Rojo > Connect

## Recent Decisions
- Using simple one-word aliases (serve, build, game, board)
- All project context lives in `.context/` folder

## Quick Reference

```
serve     - Start Rojo server
build     - Build game file
game      - Go to game folder
board     - See work board
commands  - Show all commands
```

## Notes
Dad set up aliases to make development easy!
