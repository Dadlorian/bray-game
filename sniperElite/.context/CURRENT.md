## What We Built This Session

### Great Wall Redesign

- **Length:** 300 → 400 studs
- **Material:** Concrete → Ancient Stone Bricks
- **Style:** Removed battlements, kept it PLAIN like Great Wall of China
- **Ground:** Expanded to 500x600 studs total

### Destroyed Towers (Lore!)
- Two ruined towers at each end of the wall
- Broken/tilted stone pieces
- Rubble scattered on the ground
- Tells a story: "What happened to the other guards?"

### Sniper Tower Upgrades
- **Stone construction** matching the ancient wall
- **Roof with open sides** - see in ALL directions
- **Corner posts** holding up the roof (12 studs of headroom!)
- **Wooden sniper ledge** sticking out from the front
  - Support beams underneath
  - Side rails only
  - FRONT IS OPEN - look straight down!

### Audio
