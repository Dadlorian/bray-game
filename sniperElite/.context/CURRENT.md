## Status
**Session:** 2025-01-12
**Focus:** Elevating the Tutorial Game with Professional Assets

## Where We Are
- Basic sniper game is WORKING
- Rojo connected and syncing
- Ready to upgrade visuals with real 3D models

## Next Action
**Phase 1, Step 1.1:** Open the Toolbox in Roblox Studio

1. In Studio menu: **View > Toolbox**
2. A panel will open with search and model browsing
3. Try searching "target" to see what's available

## Quick Reference

```
tutorial  - Go to tutorial-game folder
serve     - Start Rojo server
board     - See full development board
commands  - Show all commands
```

## Today's Goal
Complete **Phase 1: Master the Toolbox** - learn how to find, add, and manage 3D models from Roblox's Creator Store

## Recent Decisions
- Using Toolbox/Creator Store for models (safest, built-in)
- Prioritize "Endorsed Models" (verified by Roblox)
- Low poly models preferred for performance
- Test after every single step

## Tips for This Session
- **Endorsed badge** = safe to use
- Avoid models with lots of scripts
- Simple meshes work best with existing code
- If a model breaks shooting, try a different one
